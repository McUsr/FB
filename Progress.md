Progress
=======

2023-01-10 Design complete.
23-01-31 Due to messy commit history, I am starting all
over, the `fboneshot` and `fbrestore` routines, which are
the command line tools for making spontaneous backups into
the FB/OneShot directory of a Google Drive are now finished.

I am contining with the work on the governor, it's scripts,
the Documentation,  and the services now in order to finish
this off, into a great tool for making both periodic and
spontanoeus folder backups in ChromeOs.
