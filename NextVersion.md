The next version will let you start at least making Periodic Snapshots of folders, the simple way, with an fbinstall <Scheme> <folder> or something like it, and an fbctl command that has the necessary things to stop the backup job, without people having to start digging in the "secret sauce".
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or other feedback, considering it, when you have tested it, like the install process, is as it must be at the moment, but eventually, I want to distribute it as an apt package for installation locally, in --user space, within your $HOME folder.
