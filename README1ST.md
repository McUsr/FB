README First!
-------------

There are currently no install script, you will have to
manually copy over the files from `FB/.local` to `~/.local`
for example with: `cp -r ~/FB/.local ~/.local`


Do not do it before you [aligned your
system](https://github.com/McUsr/FB/blob/main/Docs/User/Installation.md)!


Thank you.
